- The music recommendation systems are dedicated to extracting semantic and emotional information from various musical entities such as digital audio files, the main page of a band's Web page, lyrics and behavioural activities concerning the user’s current song.

- Collaborative filtering [1] is almost a household name in the recommendation community. Its superior performance has survived the precipitation of time, and it is a classic recommendation algorithm. Collaborative filtering can be roughly divided into memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering.
